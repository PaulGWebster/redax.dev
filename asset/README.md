# Stages

## Stage 0 - the one that does not exist, but everything relies on

Please read and do as stated in src/base/README.md

## NOTES

Use the initial gcc/debian build stage to build meson/pkg-config/glib but not install them
destroy/remove apt/dpkg etc... and then make install for the first stage.
